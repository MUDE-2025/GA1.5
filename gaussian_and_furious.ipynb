    "In this assignment, you will work with data on passing maneuvers from a fixed-based driving simulator experiment (you can read more about it [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iatssr.2016.07.001)!) to assess the safety of these maneuvers. This type of analysis is key to better understand conflicts between drivers and better estimate possible crashes.\n",
