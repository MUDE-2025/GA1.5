    "In the plots above, it is possible to see the influence of the conditionalization in the univariate marginals, $S$ and $P$. We have conditionalized $d$ in a value above its mean. Since the correlation between $d$ and $S$ is positive, the distribution of $S$ moves towards positive values; increasing values of $d$ imply also higher values of $S$. Also, the conditional distribution of $S$ becomes narrower as the model has more information. \n",

    "On the other hand, $P$ is not strongly correlated to $d$, presenting a weak negative correlation ($\\rho_{d,P}=-0.19$). Therefore, the marginal distribution does not suffer a change as noteworthy as the distribution of $S$. Although it is difficult to distinguish from the plot, the standard deviation of $P$ gets slightly reduced and the distribution shifts towards negative values; increasing values of $d$ imply decreasing values of $P$.\n",
